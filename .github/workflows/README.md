# GitHub Actions Workflows

The  [PR](push_pr.yaml) workflow runs on Pull Requests to the ubuntu-20.04-upgrade branch, 
which only contain changes to python files. If no python file is affected it doesn't run.
The same applies to the [Push](Push.yaml) workflow respectively for pushes. 

The [tag](tag.yaml), [releasepr](releasepr.yaml) and [publishRelease](publishRelease.yaml) workflows are used for the new [Release Workflow](../../docs/source/diagrams/release-workflow.png). 
They use reuseable workflows from the [indy-shared-gha](https://github.com/hyperledger) repository and the following workflow in this folder.

+ [reuseable_test.yaml](reuseable_test.yaml)
   This workflow runs the tests inside the uploaded docker images.
