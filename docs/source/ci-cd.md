# Continuous Integration / Delivery
The same process from [indy-node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/main) is used.
It is described in detail in the indy-node repistories [ci-cd.md](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/main/docs/source/ci-cd.md).
It is possible to run the process for plenum independent from node.
